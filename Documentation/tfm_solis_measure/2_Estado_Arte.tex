\chapter{State of the art}

This chapter explains techniques and studies related to this work. The techniques explained in this chapter are related to \textit{Big Data}, information systems made with simple microcontrollers and Internet of Things projects.\\

\section{Big Data studies}

Big Data is a recent technology based on systems which require huge amount of information. The information produced in Big Data systems refers to sensors and machine. These sensors and machines automatically produce information which is stored in \textit{Information Systems}. The information Systems have resources to store huge amount of information, and also, can analyse the information stored to present results and predictions.\\

There are studies which use this technology. Also, there are companies which use this technology as a business strategy. Some of them, are explained in this section.

\begin{itemize}

\item Google constantly develops new products and services that have big data algorithms. Google uses big data to refine its core search and ad-serving algorithms.

\item Autonomous driving. Companies involve in Autonomous Driving use Big Data to design algorithms. These algorithms recognize objects, people and also, take information from the different external factors that have influence on driving experience\cite{bmw_driving}.

\item Energy Future Holdings Corporation is an electric utility company. The majority of the company's power generation is through coal- and nuclear-power plants. The company used Big data to install smart meters. The smart meters allows the provider to read the meter once every 15 minutes rather than one month.

\item McLaren Racing Limited is a British Formula One team. The racing car team uses real-time car sensor data during car races, identifies issues with its racing cars using predictive analytics and takes corrective actions pro-actively before it is too late.

\item Verizon uses big data to enhance mobile advertising. A unique identifier is created when the user registers in the website. The identifier allows advertiser to use information from the desktop computer. Marketing messages can be delivered to you mobile phone using this information.

\end{itemize}

\section{Information Systems based on microcontrollers}

During last years, microcontrollers became more important on \textit{Information Systems}. They have important features and can offer control to different devices to get information. Obtaining information from systems is one of the most important epics in Information Systems.\\

There are several studies where microcontrollers are used in Information Systems. Most important studies are explained in this section:

\begin{itemize}

\item Smart Room Temperature Controller Atmega\cite{smart_room_controller}. This project is used as an alternative to control the temperature of a room. It measures the temperature of a room and notify the user when the threshold is reached.

\item Automatic water plants\cite{diy_blokefollow_watering_nodate}. The developer uses a microcontroller to control when it is needed to water plants. It has a designed circuit for its specific purpose.

\item An Automated Metrics System to Measure and Improve the Success of Laboratory Automation Implementation\cite{benn_automated_2006}. It is an application which collects information from a distributed system. The data has collected over 20 months from at least 28 different workstations. This system prints charts and generates analysis with the stored information.

\end{itemize}

\section{First studies of compaction methods}

\section{Proctor compaction test}

\section{Variables that affect the compaction of floors}

\section{Applications of the compaction processes}

In this section it will be explained the main applications of the compaction of floors. It is important to say that in this study it is not pretended to use this technique for all its applications. In this study it is needed to use this technique to get more accurate measure of different floors.\\

The main applications of this technique are described in the following points.

\begin{itemize}

\item Increasing the density and the weight of a floor.

\item Increasing load carrying capacity.

\item Preventing soil from sinking

\item Increasing the resistance of soils.

\item Reducing water runoff.

\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives of the compaction}

This section, explains the necessary to compact floors and the main objectives found with this technique.\\

This process looks for a better performance in floors extracting air particles contained in the materials that form part of them. Compaction can also be applied to other processes. This project uses this technique to study how works the drying process in floors.\\

If we have this information about floors, we can also get information about how is the behaviour of a floor when the ambient variables are presented. It allows to get information about how to use some materials with adverse conditions. It also allows us to choose the best materials for determined conditions.\\

In this study this technique was used for the following purposes.

\begin{itemize}

\item Distributing the humidity in a floor.

\item Extracting the air contained in a floor.

\item Obtaining more accurate measures.

\end{itemize}
